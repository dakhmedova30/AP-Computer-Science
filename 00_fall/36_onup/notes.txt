Types of Errors:
- Compile-Time Errors: Indicate there is something wrong with the syntax of the program.
    - Ex: Omitting the semicolon at the end of a statement.
- Run-Time Errors: Produced if something goes wrong while the program is running.
    - Ex: An infinite recursion eventually causes a StackOverflowError.
- Logic Errors: Cause the program to do the wrong thing.
    - Ex: An expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect.


Compile-Time Errors:
- The key is to start with a working program and add small amounts of code at a time.
- Look for common syntax errors:
    1. Check all parentheses + brackets.
    2. Uppercase vs. lowercase.
    3. Check for semicolons.
    4. Check quotations ("" for String, '' for char).
    5. Type on the left is the same as the type on the right. Expression on the left is a variable name/assignment of value.
    6. Arguments are in the correct order + have the right type.
    7. Value method returns, void method does not return.
    8. Instance method is invoked with an object of the right type. Specify class name when invoking a static method outside of the class where it is defined.
    9. Inside an instance method, instance variables can be reffered to without specifying an object. Trying it in a static method with or without "this": “non-static variable x cannot be referenced from a static context.”

- Make a backup of your file and delete + check certain sections for errors.


Run-Time Errors:
- "Hanging": Infinite loop or infinite recursion.
- Add print statements to your program (in your loop).
- Remove/comment out unncessary print statements.
- Scale down the problem.
- Clean up the code.

- Exceptions:
    NullPointerException:
      - Tried to access an instance variable or invoke a method on an object that is currently null.
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:
      - The index used to access an array is either negative or greater than array.length - 1.
    StackOverflowError:
      - Infinite recursion.
    FileNotFoundException:
      - Java did not find the file it was looking for.
    ArithmeticException:
      - Something went wrong during an arithmetic operation (ex: division by zero).


Logic Errors:
- Break the program into components (classes + methods) and test them independently.
    - Integer division always rounds toward zero. Use double for fractions.
    - Floating-point numbers are only approximate, not perfectly accurate. Never use the == operator with doubles. Instead of (d == 1.23), do if (Math.abs(d - 1.23) < .000001).
    - Equality operator (==) checks whether objects are identical, equals method checks for equivalence.
    - Equals checks identity, override it to check for other equivalence.
    - Inheritence can lead to logic errors.
    
- Break complex expressions into a series of assignments.
- Change some or all print statements to println (if print statements are not working).

- Take a break!
- Ask someone for help + explain the problem to them.
- Consult ducky.
