# 0. What does "base" in "base-X number system" mean?
"Base" is the number of values possible to use in any decimal place.
For example, base 10 can include the values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 -- which is a total of 10 values.


# 1. What is binary and why do we, in computing, care?
Binary is base 2, and a form of information storage, where each unit of information has two possible states (ex: 0 and 1, true and false, on and off).
We care about binary in computing because it provides the basis of computer science and is mainly used to store data in computers.
For instance, binary is used in the transistors that make up a computer's circuits to indicate the on and off states with "1" and "0".


# 2. Express an algorithm for converting from binary to decimal.
n = x<sub>d</sub> * x<sub>d-1</sub> ... x<sub>1</sub> * x<sub>0</sub>
n = âˆ‘ (x * 2<sup>s</sup>)
Z, 0 <= x <= 1

where:
n = binary number
x = digit, starting with the left-most digit
d = digit number
s = exponent (last digit: s = 0)


# 3. Express an algorithm for converting from decimal to binary.
int i = 0;
while x > 0 {
  rem[i] = x % 2;
  i++;
}
for (int n = i - 1; n >= 0; n++)
  System.out.println(rem[n]);

Write down the decimal number and divide by 2 continuously.
Make sure to note the remainder (1 or 0) from top to down until the final quotient is zero.
Lastly, list out the 1's and 0's bottom-up (backward) to get the binary conversion.
