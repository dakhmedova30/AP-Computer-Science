DISCO
- I wasted like 30 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with my code bc it kept printing the pre order
  for all three traversals. Turns out I recursively recalled preOrderTrav instead of in or post...
- Making a tree and comparing what you get vs ur program def helps


QCC
- What if the value that you are adding is equal to the currnode's value?
- What does stnode mean? I assume its the root of the subtree


arbore arbol :

      1   3   6

L = levels d = depth h = height
a perfect binary tree has L! nodes
at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^depth nodes
height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is ceiling of ln(n) + 1???

this math is probably and certainly wholly incorrect :/
