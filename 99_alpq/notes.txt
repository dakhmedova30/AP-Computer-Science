DISCO:
* It was very ez to code all of this because we wrote it all out on our plan.
* It was also mucho ez because most of the heavy lifting came from the prewritten methods for ArrayList.

QCC:
* I'm assuming the next order of business is to do this but with a Linked List just as we had with a dequeue.
